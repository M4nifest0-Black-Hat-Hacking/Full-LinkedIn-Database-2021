# Full-LinkedIn-Database-2021
Personal data for 700 million LinkedIn users—nearly 93% of the company’s members—has been put up for sale online. Hackers have already posted a sample of the data, which included information for 1 million users, according to a report on RestorePrivacy.🙈 👌The data appears to be recent, with samples from 2020 and 2021, according to the report. In a statement to Fortune, a LinkedIn spokesperson disputes this, saying, "We’ve investigated, and there is no evidence that this is new data or that the data is from 2020 and 2021."👍 😳 The price for that enormous collection of data? $5,000. 🗣The data examined by the site did not include login credentials or financial information, but it did include a wealth of personal information that could be used to assume someone’s identity, including:👇 ✍️ Full names ✍️ Phone numbers ✍️ Physical addresses ✍️ Email addresses ✍️ Geolocation records ✍️ LinkedIn usernames and profile URLs ✍️ Personal and professional experiences and backgrounds ✍️ Genders ✍️ Other social media accounts and usernames Torrent file size 480 KB Total file size 180 GB Total countries Good luck
